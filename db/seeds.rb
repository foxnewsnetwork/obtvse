The words describing this concept has been endlessly repeated to all of us, I'm sure, and so rang as hollowfully comforting as the worst of platitudes. \n\nYet, although the words are so often repeated, the ideas behind them are apparently as foreign and fantastic as ever. I say after conservsing with a friend and fellow software engineer yesterday. As I recall, we had been on the subject of movies and, in particular, the works of one Guerillmo Del Toro (I refer to him as Del Taco).\n\n>  Del Taco works like 17-18 hours a day everyday on his movies; he clearly\n>  loves what he does. That must be really cool; to actually be extremely\n>  passionate about your work so much so that you can do it for fun and work.\n\nTo which my friend replies with:\n\n>  Yeah, but he's letting himself enjoy any of the finer things of life [in\n>  his singlemindedness]\n\nI had thought he meant that Del Taco simply managed to delude himself into believing the mundane to be the spectacular, so I had countered with\n\n>  Well, he probably travels and whatnot for his movies and so gets his jollies\n>  there as a part of both play and work\n\nTo which my friend stated.\n\n>  Yeah, but that's not quite real fun.\n\nThat's when it hit me, despite the age-old adage that we, as members of some supposed first world magical enlightened disneyland, ought all be working as happily as beavers in some sing-song dam building cartoon... yet we truly do not believe in our heads that such a fabled fairytale - that normal people can find work to be fun and would work for free - could exist. \n\nPerhaps through our lack of faith, or perhaps as a justification of it, we find our world truly unable to bring us that happiness in working through living. This for me is a revalation of the grandest scheme because it reveals the underlying reason behind our culture of not-good-enough, our envy of the success of others, and our resignation that we ought just grind through the day, weeks, months, and years at our place of employment and seek soul-enriching sustenance only through auxillaries like friends, family, vacation, video games, and for those fortunate enough to still have Him, God. (Sorry, purple prose)\n\nThe reason is:\n\n#### We don't believe\n\nWe don't believe work can every be truly satisfying and pleasurable so we don't try to find work that will be satisfying and pleasurable to ourselves. Instead, we look for work that pays a lot of money, is \"hot on the market\", or is a stepping stone to a job that pays a lot of money or is hot on the market. And so when price becomes our driving motive, the economics (and not even the good ones from the Austrian school, but the evil Kinesian ones) have won; we become whorish cogs in their elegantly cruel models of human behavior.\n\nWe aren't happy with or at our work because we never expected it to be in the first place - we just expected to be (eventually) paid a lot of money so we can retire and do things we want. Because of that, we work without passion or energy and look for the first opportunity to go on a vacation to relieve our souls of the stress of the daily grind and so never achieve fame or fortune - are never good enough. Just as one does not simply walk in Mordor, one does not simply grind ones way to wealth, fame, and happiness.\n\nSo what's my takeaway on all this? I don't know yet; find another job maybe? I haven't the foggiest idea. But perhaps I will sometime in the future when I do figure it out and try it out. Maybe I'll write a part 2 then." )

No amount of money will ever get me to work in a downtown big city ever again.\n\nToday during work, I had the infinite wisdom to tune into the TED talks. To truly internalize what these amazingly brilliant and wise people have said, I suppose I will attempt to recall and summarize the content of their talks here.\n\n# On creativity, the muse, and writing\n## From the author of Eat, Pray, Love\n\nCreativity and, in particular, the act of creating is something inherently divine. It is something that in ancient greek and roman times, we associated with daemons, muses, and fairies. However, since the Rennaissance, we've started to attribute the divine inspirtation of creativity to humanity ourselves.\n\nThis, unfortunately, exerts extreme pressure authors, song-writers, and the other creative talent that drives the content generation at the same time it overloads them with hubris and pride. With creativity internalized as something deeply individualistic and personal, creators and the audience they create for begin attributing this formerly divine power to a mere human. And although during the creative process, a mere human writer perhaps is indeed filled with a mysterious spirit of divinity, there is a distinct separation between the two.\n\nAs according to the author of Eat, Love, Pray, who fears that her best work is behind her, we should separate the divine creative spirit from the mechanism of creation (for the most part, that's us scrawling on paper or muling away on a keyboard). In doing so, we both rid the intense pressure of expected divinity from ourselves as well as the hubris of having become divine at a certain point in our lives.\n\nAlso, Ole.\n\n# On Liars\n## From a social-pscyh behavorist\n\nLying is apparently something deeply routed in our genetics.

Timid as most ethnic 3rd world women, her voice was quiet as she plied, in the heavy accented English, the same line \"help please\" or something similar to each row of passengers on the train as her child walked in front of her (at least I persume that's her child). \n\nAnd, each and every single passenger on the train, in his or her own coldly timid way, abjectly ignored the shit out of her and her plight.\n\nNow, I refuse to believe that the passengers on this train are all cold cynical twisted souls like myself, nor can I bring myself to believe everyone on the this train were too poor to spare even a meager coin or bill. So why then are people in one of the wealthiest cities in the world, people who actively give to charity their time and money, people who are considered by the rest of America as a bunch of homosexual faggot socialists, so closed and unsocialist-like on this BART train every afternoon in the rush-hour commute? \n\nWhat is it about public transit that, despite the close physical proximity between individuals, we feel none of the spiritual closeness that humans are capable of feeling even for completely faceless anonymous strangers on various internet boards? \n\nFrom what I know about social-psychology, which despite my keen interest is meager at best, cases such as the Genevasse stabbing case in New York suggests the cold-unfeelingness of city folk is a result of the diffusion of responsibility... so is some extended version of that diffusion the root cause of why no one even bothers giving even eye-contact much less time or money to the impoverished single mother? \n\nIf diffusion of responsibility is the cause of this, then would people like me feel compelled to give if the people (my peers on the train) gave her money? Introspectively speaking, I highly doubt I would even if driven by peer pressure; if anything, I would probably feel more disgusted at the very prospect (although that might just be me). \n\nAnyway, I don't have an answer (or even a hypothesis) to this puzzle. So all I will say is this: the city brings out the worst in all of us. The characteristics of apathy, pride, contempt, and even hatred simmer deep within the city and it seems to infect all of us. The industrial revolution and technological clustering might have made life more \"convenient\" for those of us living today, but we bought that convenience with a vital part of soul and humanity....\n\nNow back to coding angular" )

How do we not find ourselves\nfilled with resentment towards those who have CLEARLY worked less (or at least\nlived less) but have already found tremendous success?\n\nAs always with the hardest questions in life, the answer had always been there\nin plain sight just waiting for good ol' stupid me to see it.\n\n\nYou know, I used to think and feel just as you do currently, enveloped by resentment and hatred both at my own inability and at the success of others. And for over a decade, I pushed myself hard in the pursuit of some fleeting dream of success. \n\nDoes this sound like you, also, anon?\n\nDo you work / read / learn while your high school / college / work friends go out on dates, parties, and vacations? Do you feel gnawing guilt whenever you're not working? Whenever you don't get enough done at work? Do the things you used to enjoy, be they video games, anime, or simply just zoning out in front of a wall no longer bring the same giddiness and joy to your heart? Do you feel that life, despite all you have and haven't achieved, all the dreams and ambitions you've realized or still\npine for, that you still feel your life is meaningless?\n\nIf this describes you, anon, take some time this week and completely unplug. Go somewhere by yourself away from the city, away from the people, the cars, the buildings, the internet, and all the hustle bustle interconnectivity that has taken over our lives. Go lie down under a starry sky where you're the only thing between the spinning Earth and the endless sky - these are things that were here before you and will remain here long after you. Ask yourself your place in this universe and ponder\nyour position in life. \n" )

Perhaps for the simplest fizzbuzz\nplayaround apps, the disadvantages of this sort of approach is not as obvious,\nbut as soon as the projects gets a little bigger and the developer begins worry-\ning a bit more about modularity, the sheer idiocy of this naive approach shines\nthrough.\n\nFirst and foremost, lumping one's business logic directly with the logic of\npersisting state implies that one's persistance (i.e. db sql) skills should be\ndba-level top-tier. Else, any sort of change of normalization, cache-layer\nintroduction, and whatever else immediately deprecates one's business logic\nin addition to the current database logic.\n\nThe marriage of table-to-model also suggests that, all inconsistencies in one's\ndatabase must then be handled spread out through one's model. This leads to the\ninfamous conditional if-statement clusterfuck that produces such incomprehensible\nshit such as iOffer's 750+ line long methods.\n\nFinally, a particular weakness of Rails's implementation of ActiveRecord is the\npreference of using nil to represent failed lookups instead of the more helpful\nmaybe.

The mutual consensus was that Angelo,\nbeing by himself in part of America where everyone is older than him and likely\nfrom an entire different walk of life, was very lonely. I tend to agree with this.\nThere is quite nothing nearly as soul-crushingly depressing as the thought that\neveryone around you will go home at 5 or 6 and just loiter in the livihood of his\nor her family and loved ones while you go home to play DotA (possibly by yourself).\n\nNot that there is anything wrong with DotA or playing by oneself - in fact, one who\nis so able to derive fun in life even despite lonliness is quite blessed. But there\nis something decidedly wrong with being in a situation where such drastic measures\nis necessary.\n\nIn particular, AMD... with heavy emphasis on Colorado.\n\nAngelo, is this what you really wanted to do? Granted you always wanted to work in\ntech, and possible fiddle with Verilog, but is getting cooped up for several years \nto a lifetime playing with circuits for some mediocre corporation in a part of the\nworld that's far from family, friends, and fun truly worth your time? Angelo, you\nare in your twenties with a masters from a respected institution. You are in a time\nof your life where boundless energy perfects the wild arc of ambition in the youth-\nful eye. Yet here you sit, rotting away in the lifestyle meant for people 10+ years\nolder than you.\n\nIf you believe the vicissitudes of voltage, current, Verilog, and quirky bugs to be\ndeeply meaningful, then good for you, you've found a place you belong. But if not,\nwhat are you doing in Colorado? \n\nThe other day, I heard of the article written by a staff columnist at the NyTimes (\nor was it Washington Post?) speaking of one woman writer's journey out of college \nand into the real world. Unlike us science / engineering students, she was a business\nmajor, but she faced a choice strikingly similar to our own when she went to an\ninterview for a position at the Quaker Oats company.\n\nThe interviewer at the time asked her a rather cannonical question, \"why do you want\nto work at Quaker Oats\"\n\nA truly simple question.\n\nOne we've all heard before and probably answered without much thought with bullshit.\n\nBut this woman gave it deep thought: \"do I truly want to be selling oats for my life?\"\nAnd walked out the building and into something that was dualy meaningful and rewarding\nfor her. Such action neither stunted her professional growth nor physio-emotion health." )

He was probably an elementary school child - I well remember\nmyself doing the very same thing back in elementary school. At first, he tried against\n3 probably wealth businessmen (who were probably headed home toward Lafeyette), who\nalthough sociable and friendly, purchased nothing. He then asked two elder women,\nprobably hippies who were to bound to transfer for Richmond and Berkeley, who also\npurchased nothing. Then a black dude, who, perhaps for solidarty, or perhaps out of\njust simple compassion, gave the boy $3.\n\nI leave myself out of this, but I happened to ignore him. At the time, I had no better\nreason than the ugly fact and irritating truth that I'm cheaper than I hope to be, and\nprobably more racist than I can be proud of. As the boy walked past me, perhaps with a\nlook of hurt disappointment on his face (I didn't look because I am weak), I felt quite\nwretched - I had not expected to be reminded of my own personal weakness of character\nafter an exhausting day dipshitting at work.\n\nBut at the same time, the cynical bitterness that has, for better or for worse (who am I\nkidding, of course it's for worse) become a part of my character, instead snarled at the\nschools that put the boy up to this. Some principal or teacher or PTA or superintendent\nsomewhere, no doubt, thought it would be a great idea to exploit the wide-eyed innocence\nof children to further their capitalistic greed for more money. \n\n\"Donate,\" I could almost hear their words reverbrating in my ear, \"Or be known far and wide\nthat you are a cheapskate unsympathetic cynical bastard scrooge of a soul.\" All the while\nhinting strongly, \"Donate, and be a tool for us.\"\n\nAs it was, I defaulted to the cheapskate scrooge route because through inaction (well, not\nnecessarily true, I was technically passing rspec tests). But, in all truth, I was at a loss.\nSo much of today has become founded upon putting a person at a juxtaposition of his\nconflicting ideals. Conflict, even on this small scale, rises to the surface for something as\nsimple as some one or two dollars.\n\nPerhaps I'm simply overthinking this, but why has life become so complicated?" )

It is a hurdle, an\nobstacle, some sort of painful trial I must overcome to continue doing what-\never it is that is meaningful to me. Is this a common symptom of the employed\npopulation? If so, why then has life become so devoid of all interest and\nmeaning? Since when did we all become cronies slaving away under some nameless\n(or well named and possibly even branded) organization selling quaker oats or\ntapping on a keyboard?\n\nI have become convinced, for as long as I work in San Francisco, I will never\nattain either meaning or happiness. All I do end up doing is wasting away my\ntime for meager amounts of money most of which I don't actually need. \n\nOn Modularity Within Rails\n=\nIt should come as no surprise to anyone who has used Rails for more than a few\nmonths that it does not encourage writing modular or reuseable code. Rails, by\ndefault convention, request the following structure for your app:\n\n  --app\n  |-- model\n    |-- activerecord\n    |-- activerecord\n    |-- ...\n  |-- controller\n    |-- applicationcontroller\n    |-- applicationcontroller\n    |-- ...\n  |-- view\n    |-- [model-name]\n      |-- .erb / .haml view\n  -- config\n    |-- initializer\n      |-- your_initializer\n\nThis sort of structure is akin to storing your pants in a drawer for pants, storing\nyour shirt in a cabinent for shirts, etc. Naively, it's well organized and the\nstructure is possibly reasonable and logic (at least well within the definitions of\nthe much lauded MVC framework). Unfortunately, because all your pants are with your\nother pants, you, as the code monkey, will forever be stuck in your closest (place\nof work), doomed to sew up new pants when the old ones fit your closet less well.\n\nOf course, because it is a closet, your place of work will likely never suit you\nlike a good getup of jeans, shirt, hat, etc. You find yourself never being able to\ntake your favorite getup (code asset) and run away with it to find freedom in the\nworld outside your stuffy closet.\n\nSo to future devs who read this, which will probably just be me (the writer), please\nstructure applications and assets as follows\n\n  --app\n    |-- model\n      |-- forum (in example)\n        |-- views\n          |-- partials\n        |-- api\n          |-- controller\n            |-- controllers\n          |-- apptie (like a railtie, it tells future apps how to use your model)\n        |-- thread\n          |-- activerecord (or other persistence engine)\n          |-- post\n            |-- activerecord\n        |-- user\n          |-- activerecord\n          |-- post\n            |-- activerecord (yes, this probably references the same table as thread::post)\n      |-- other \"models\"\n    |-- controller\n      |-- application specific controllers\n    |-- views\n      |-- application specific views\n\nStructuring one's project this way allows for immediate gemification and modular version\ncontrol through use of rubygems. The productive programmer can immediately pull the forum\nmodel out of this app and drop it into its own gem or into another rails project and\nachieve immediate functionality. Code like this increases productivity and is probably\nthe biggest reason why certain top-tier programmers are able to churn out highly polished\nproduction-ready projects over the course of a few hours.\n\nAs the programmer, it will be entirely against your employer's wishes for you to write\ncode this way. Organizing your application in such a way that you can achieve plug-and-\nplay modularity gives you too much freedom and too much power. At any given moment, you\ncan pick up a huge chunk of codebase and simply use it yourself in your own application.\nCode in this style does not enforce loyalty because it has code quality. Bear that in mind\nat work. Considering the advantages of this code style, it's amazing not more enterprise\nprojects follow these standards.\n\nFortune Cookies that Get Corrupted\n=\n/ Well, anyway, I was reading this James  \\\n| Bond book, and right away I realized    |\n| that like most books, it had too many   |\n| words. The plot was the same one that   |\n| all James Bond books have: An evil      |\n| person tries to blow up the world, but  |\n| James Bond kills him and his henchmen   |\n| and makes love to several attractive    |\n| women. There, that's it: 24 words. But  |\n| the guy who wrote the book took         |\n| *thousands* of words to say it. Or      |\n| consider \"The Brothers Karamazov\", by   |\n| the famous Russian alcoholic Fyodor     |\n| Dostoyevsky. It's about these two       |\n| brothers who kill their father. Or      |\n| maybe only one of them kills the        |\n| father. It's impossible to tell because |\n| what they mostly do is talk for nearly  |\n| a thousand pages. If all Russians talk  |\n| as much as the Karamazovs did, I don't  |\n| see how they found time to become a     |\n| major world power. I'm told that        |\n| Dostoyevsky wrote \"The Brothers         |\n| Karamazov\" to raise the question of     |\n| whether there is a God. So why didn't   |\n| he just come right out and say: \"Is     |\n| there a God?

The gamble being that touchscreens\nand tablets - the stuff that metro and 8 were made for - were the way of the\nfuture and whoever doesn't get on board the train to the future be damned.\nObviously, whatever backward hillbilly who doesn't own some form of tablet must\nnot be worth supporting.\n\nQuite a strong stance for a company that has the advantage of momentum, corporate\nhistory, and public goodwill. If I was in charge of any sort of decision making at\nMicrosoft (I'm not, and there's no reason why they would bother with my opinions\nanyway), I would've hedged my bets and released a windows 8 that would be essentially\nthe EXACT same shit as windoes 7 except for differing branding and possibly minor\nUI changes in addition to the vastly different 8 metro mode... But my MSFT-employed\nfriend gave me MS's reason for their decision. I will paraphrase here:\n  \n  > Users don't know what they want, so they need to be taught and trained into\n  > wanting whatever it is we have to sell.\n\nThe statement seems to make sense; after all, it works in America - how else would\none explain the prolifterating shamwow info-mercials, penis-enlarge banner ads, or\nthe ever unnecessary sales pitch for another style of blender. But why generalized\nto only Americans? People in Asia, Europe, or Africa can be just as much a tool to\ntheir corporations (or countries) as people here.\n\nBut then, the thought occured do we truly not know what we want? Or is it more the\ncase we just don't know how to get what we want? Because truly, at our basic core,\nthe things we #can# want are truly few and all rather simple. We want to sustenace,\nrespect of others, sex (usually if male), attention (usually if female), and meaning\n(if fortunate enough to live within the first world).\n\nEvery decision we ever make falls into one of these categories and, as such, every\nproduct ever sold to us has convinced us that it will be able to help us achieve one\nof those:\n\n  > \"X, tastes great, helps you lose weight\" -> sustenance + attention\n  > \"Y makes your Z more convenient\" -> implies time for the things other than Z\n\nSo let me correct Microsoft's attitude towards its user to what it really should\nhave been had it not been for some ridiculously dumb fuckup up top:\n\n  > Users want to look cool to their friends, make money for themselves, and find\n  > meaning in their lives. They don't know how to do it, so we'll trick them into\n  > thinking getting a windows tablet will be the key to doing it.\n\nThe restatement suddenly makes it clear how marketing and management should have\napproach the metro + windows 8 project.\n\nIt is immediately obvious due to the poor typing interface, it is near impossible to\ndo work (thus make money) on the tablet. In addition, MS should realize that the\ntablet, by it's very nature, is a consumption-based tool, not a production-based tool.\nOne does not \"produce\" through \"consumption\".\n\nIt is not immediately obvious that a windows tablet will elevate one in the eyes of\nhis or her friends.

I don’t treat it as the relationships that humans\n    make between concepts we abstract from day to day life.  \n    I don’t think I get the concept of ‘two-ness’ from\n    seeing two apples, and then two people, and then two\n    houses and abstracting away from the objects to see what\n    they have in common.\n\n    I think of mathematical truths existing prior to human \n    cognition and abstraction.  The relationship goes the\n    other way.  The apples and the people and the houses are\n    all similar insofar as they share in the form of two-\n    ness, which exists independently of material things to\n    exist in pairs or human minds to think about them.\n\n  The notion that there’s something special about math –\n  that it has some sort of metaphysical significance – only\n  makes sense if you ignore the history of how we uncovered\n  math to begin with. It was, despite Leah’s protestations,\n  exactly just the abstraction of pairs and triplets and  \n  quartets, etc. The earliest known mathematics appear to be\n  attempts to quantify time and make calendars, with other\n  early efforts directed towards accounting, astronomy, and\n  engineering.\n\n  Mathematics is nothing more and nothing less a tool that’s \n  useful for humans in solving particular problems. Math can\n  be used to describe reality or construct useful fictions.\n  For example, we know now that the spacetime we live in is\n  non-Euclidian. But that doesn’t make Euclidian geometry\n  useless for everyday life. Quite the contrary – it’s used\n  every day. You can use mathematics to build models of\n  reality that may not actually have any bearing on what’s\n  real. For example, the complicated math used to describe\n  how the planets moved in the Ptolemaic model of the solar\n  system – where everything orbited in circles around the\n  Earth – actually produced very accurate predictions. But\n  it was also wrong. There aren’t actually trillions of\n  physical dollars circulating in the economy – there are\n  just symbols for them floating around.\n\n  The bottom line is that human beings have brains capable\n  of counting to high numbers and manipulating them, so we\n  use mathematics as a useful tool to describe the world\n  around us. But numbers and math themselves are no more\n  real than the color blue – ‘blue’ is just what we tag a\n  certain wavelength of light because of the way we perceive\n  that wavelength. An alien intelligence that is blind has\n  no use for the color blue. It might learn about light and\n  the wavelengths of light and translate those concepts\n  completely differently than we do.\n\n  In the same way, since the only truly good mathematicians\n  among the animals are ourselves, we assume that if we\n  encounter other systems of intelligence that they’ll have\n  the same concepts of math was we do. But there’s no\n  evidence to base that assumption on. For all we know,\n  there are much easier ways to describe physics than\n  through complicated systems of equations, but our minds\n  may not be capable of symbolically interpreting the world\n  in a way that allows us to use those tools, any more than\n  we’re capable of a tool that requires the use of a\n  prehensile tail.\n\n  Math is a useful descriptor of both real and fictional\n  concepts. It’s very fun to play around with and its\n  essential for understanding a lot of subjects. But it’s\n  just a tool. Not a set of mystical entities." )

Not only am I learning nothing from them,\nI feel every waking moment of work I put into the company results in that\nmoment being forever wasted. If this is the real world, I'd much rather\ngo back to academia / freelance.\n\nHere's my list of reasons why I absolute loathe my current place of work:\n\n# Technical Reasons\n* Lack of comprehensive test suite means any new feature that gets dev'd\n  out can mostly only be debugged and fixed in production.\n* Unnecessarily steep learning curve for everything due to stupid decisions\n  in inital code-base design stage\n* Features are proposed, built, and released with absolutely no consideration\n  of market necessity as there are no a/b tests, marketing surveys, etc.\n* Every single peice of client-side javascript code is written in procedural\n  javascript and coupled extremely intimately with the monorail app, making\n  everything anyone ever builds for iOffer remain at iOffer - absolutely 0\n  modularity\n* Follows standard rails convention for organizing by controller, model, \n  and view (and even then, we do so inconsistently) making everything highly\n  unmodular and absolutely a waste of time\n* No database data integrity or consistency, but a good portion of application\n  code depends on the database for function\n* 2013 and still on rails 2.3 and REE 187\n* No unit tests, can't even begin to write unit tests because of difficulty of\n  loading up the test environment\n\n# Management / Personal / Cultural Reasons\n* I apparently can't build anything right\n* No decent way to programatically test, but manager is nit-picky as all hell\n* Not allowed to solve problems the simplest way due to some abstract fear of\n  \"scalability issues\" and instead must invent complicated hacks to go on top\n  of already complicated hacks\n* ~3 to 4 hours of commute each day\n* I can't get along with SFers and East Coasters\n* I personally loathe the big city\n* Long commute leads to unhealthy diet\n* No communication on company vision, plans for the future, or even progress\n  report on right now from management\n* \"Done is better than perfect\" attitude leads to the creation of stupid shit\n* \"Don't fix it if it isn't really highly noticeably broken\" attitude prevents\n  refactoring and keeps alive potential problems\n* The company can't show that it needs what we build\n* Priority is on attaching more chrome and crap on top of existing chrome and\n  crap instead of fixing up and refactoring\n\nFuture Solutions\n=\n  > It's not a problem if you can't fix it\nSo, here is how I would fix these problems\n\n# Technical\n* Focus more on unit, functional, and a/b testing than feature development\n* Follow logical division of responsibility to split up code, not rails convention\n* Gemify everything and have only a dumb rails app where the gems tell it how to\n  do stuff... i.e. gems plug-and-play into a generic rails app\n* Decouple javascript and css from rails; build it separately and have it communicate\n  through standard http api with the application\n* Refactor all day everyday and keep up with ruby / rails\n* Cb + Cv * time + Ca * time * time ; NEVER increase your coding base (Cb) at the\n  cost of decreasing your coding velocity (Cv) or worse your coding acceleration (Ca).\n* If you do wind up having to increase Cb at the cost of Cv or Ca, refactor ASAP\n\n# Management\n* Only hire people who live within 5-10 miles of the office or let everyone wfh\n* Don't hire for \"cultural diversity\", hire individuals just like you\n* Constantly ask \"why\"\n* Done is only better than perfect if you were retarded enough to sell out to someone\n  super early. Write code such that it not only solves today's problems, it also\n  helps with making solving tomorrows problems easier\n* Fix it before it breaks; prevention is always better than cure\n* Follow the scientific method; propose that the company needs feature X because\n  X would help the company improve Y (where Y is a basic metric like income), then\n  a/b test and proveably show that it does\n* Less chrome and crap, instead simplify.\n\nNotes For Myself\n=\nNever again work for a company in SF, go work for your mom in Camarillo over a company\nbased in SF." )

Everyday has neither been\nfun, interesting, memorable, nor have I at any point felt I was truly\ndoing something with my life. Yet here we are, almost halfway.\n\nMildly Provocative Banner Ad\n=\nOn the train between Colisseum stop and Fruitvale on my way to work today,\nI notice a sign that read:\n\n  > 1 in 6 suffers from hunger\n  > 5 in 6 can help\n\nMaybe it's because I've since gotten tired of financial liberalism thanks\nto my constant encounters with riffraff both in college and now at work\nvia commute to SF, but that advertisement really strikes me as both annoy-\ning, and parasetic.\n\nIf 1 in 6 is suffering from hunger, why is it implied that he cannot help\nhimself? Why can only the 5 not starving help the 1 not starving? I'm not\nsaying the 5 out of 6 shouldn't help - although they do so out of their own\ngoodness of heart and violation - but definitely the 1 in 6 who actually has\nthe problem should at least try to pick himself up by his bootstraps.\n\nBut of course, that's not the case. Not according to that particular banner\nad, nor, I suppose, according to the socio-economic philosophies of the SF\nbay-area society that put that banner up. That ad seems to directly scream:\n\n  > 2013\n  > Suffering from hunger\n  > ISHYGDDT\n  > George Costanza\n\nAnd it implies strongly that we as a society have absolutely no faith in\nthese bumbling pitiful fools who still manages to go hungry in one of the\naffluent places on Earth. Not only do we not believe they can do better,\nwe fully expect they'll only do worse. And, through our confidence in their\ninability, we further affirm these people into the negative cycle of poor\nperformance (forgot technical sociology name, sorry blog) that pins these\nhobos to their pee-ridden sleeping bags in the first place.\n\nSolution\n=\nAs usual, it's not a problem if I don't have a solution. And in this case,\nthe immediate solution is simple - change the second line from 5 in 6 can help\nto everyone can help. The long term solution is significantly trickier and\nprobably can only be solved through some sort of natural diaster." )
Post.create( :title => "Wednesday Morning", :slug => "wednesday-morning", :draft => true, :content => "=\nHump day; my friend's birthday this weekend. Be sure to get something for him!\n\nBetween Union City and Fremont, I passed by a small lake with some volleyball courts. It is usually emmpty - especially this time of day in the morning when much of the working (aka enslaved) population is forced to head to work - but today, young folk (good looking people in their 20s) are having a barbeque and playing volleyball.\n\n  > Ah, youth, sunlight, good food, and delightful fun.\n\nTo be quite honest, this day - a Wednesday spent happily with friends away from work or (most likely) school - will be what carves the deepest mark in their hearts. Far more so than the 365 24/7 hustle-bustle of eeking out money, it is doing the things that bring to our souls sunlight that we will always remember. It might seem bleedingly obvious when spoken aloud, but it is only in living are we worth of being alive... although sometimes, in the busy days of commute back and forth between meaningless work in the big city and an austere spartan lifestyle back at a house far away from home, I tend to frequently forget even the glaringly obvious.\n\nBut of course, it's not a problem if I don't have a solution. And unfortunately this time, I only have a solution for myself: quit my job and start freelancing. As for everyone else, locked in as you may be by responsibility, obligation, and duty, what I refer to as the soulless depravation of our basic humanity may not even be a problem - it might be your only solution.\n\nOn \"Done is better than perfect\"\n=\nEven though the exact words are printed on only 1 peice of paper on the second floor of where I work, its message resounds loud and clear everywhere I am within the walls of the San Franciscian office of iOffer. And it is the spectre of stupidity - the original root cancer - that has caused the shipwreck clusterfuck mess where I now spend my hours toiling fruitlessly in an attempt to improve.\n\n\"Done is better than perfect\" is the core philosophy that will lead one's company down the road of mediocrity and eventual obscurity.\n\nHere's why.\n\nConsider the following two snippets of code\n\n### Done better than perfect\n  ```ruby\n  for c in cats\n    for d in dogs\n      if c.is_a? Cat\n        ...\n        if d.is_a? Dog || d.is_a? Wolf\n          ...\n          if c.barks? || d.eats?\n            ...\n            if d.meows? && c.coughs?\n              ...\n            elsif d.rolls?\n              ...\n            else\n              ...\n            end\n          else\n            if d.whatever?\n              ...\n  ```\n\n### (Closer to) perfect\n  ```ruby\n  mcats = cats.map { |c| CatConverter.to_maybe_cat c }\n  mdogs = dogs.map { |d| DogConverter.to_maybe_dog d }\n  mdogs.product(mcats).map { |cat_and_dog| FightBox.fight *cat_and_dog }\n  ```\n\n  ```ruby\n  describe Cat do\n    ...\n  end\n  describe Dog do\n    ...\n  end\n  ...\n  ```\n\nThe DBTP version is easy; it usually is written up at specification time to provide an extremely rudimentary model of what we exact our code to do. It is a clusterfuck of unmaintainable conditional code (it's actually cleaner than what I see at work because I'm not using local variables in the nested conditionals)... but it gets the job done and seems to be making money for the company. Why bother with refactoring to the closer to perfect code? Why bother writing up specs and tests? Those don't make money for the company!\n\nBut what iOffer doesn't get is that DBTP code is exactly what Martin Fowler calls \"technical debt\" and, although it seems to be bringing in money, it doubles, triples, or even possibly 10x company development / expansion costs down the road. Next to literaily saying \"fuck you, future developers\" as you hire on new people, DBTP code is the closest a company can get to saying \"fuck you, future developers\".\n\nSo why is unrefactored / leaky-abstraction / inconsistent designed / unmodular code so godawful?\n\n* Steep (completely unnecessary) learning curve keeps most developers from ever being useful or productive\n* Sets bad example to future developers who are then forced to contribute to the cancer at hand\n* Code inertia prevents rapid adjustments and efficiency\n* Wastes time and resources and slows down future development\n* Gives your employees cancer and makes them hate you\n\nSo there you go, if you don't have the disicpline to write decent code and decent tests, then your company will most assuredly bleed out. You've done everything in your power to create a shithole where you're not so much hiring developers to think and improve your product as you're hiring prostitues to scratch your immediate itch. So if you're a CEO or a company, please don't do this... else I just might come back and crush your business\n" )
Post.create( :title => "Anon's Story", :slug => "anons-story", :draft => true, :content => "=\nYesterday, while browsing 4chan /a/ after work, I came across an anon pouring out his heart and telling his deeply personal lifestory. It is too long (and grammatically rough) to repost as is in here so I simply summarize, edit, and retell it here:\n\nI grew up in a quiet sleepy town in Virigina. My family wsan't poor, but we definitely were not rich enough to afford traveling everywhere or providing me with enough diversions to keep me busy. As such, in an age before the internet, computers, and video games, I went about the town with my friends causing all sorts of ruckus. By the age of 7, I had already made a name for myself as a local troublemaker.\n\nOn one particular trouble-making incident, a friend and I hid in what we've informally named the \"Boo Radley\" house and entertained ourselves by throwing eggs at passersby. Most of our victims hurled curses, threats, and or inarticulate bursts of rage at us - much to our amusement.\n\nBut then, we had the misfortune of slamming an egg onto the face of a man in a fancy suit, who, with a scream of rage came directly at us.\n\nTerrified in the sort of way that only a 7 year old could, my friend and I ran for our lives in separate ways firmly convinced that this was it. One of us won't be making it to our next egg-throwing. Fortunately, we were young, fast, and our enemy was in a suit and we both quickly escaped to the safety of our individual homes.\n\nBut my home was no longer safe. And to abject horror, the man in the suit was already at my home speaking to my dad as I entered the door. I can't recall what exact was said, but my dad was enraged and I wound up being exchanged to help the man-in-the-suit paint his house as recrimination - and I had better not do a shoddy job of it. Great, now I'm shackled into indentured servitude to paint over multiple days a large house for a man who hates me.\n\nThe first morning of painting comes and goes and afterwards, the man-in-the-suit (who was longer in his suit during the painting process), invited me inside to have post-work sandwiches and watermelon after we had finished with the painting work that for that day. And, as I wolf down my sandwich, I chanced upon an anime-cliche-esque encounter with a 7 year old girl - the man's daughter.\n\nI greeted the girl, introduced myself as mommy and daddy had instructed upon meeting someone. The girl stammered out some reply, she seemed ready to say more, but her mother called her and she scurried back out the kitchen and up the stairs.\n\nLater that night, I asked my parents about the man-in-the-suit (he persumably also had other clothe) and in particular about his daughter - the town I am from was small, there ought to be no 7 year old here I didn't already know about. What my mom and dad told me then was something straight out of a Key visual novel.\n\nApparently, the girl was born with a weak heart and so she had to be home-schooled so she didn't have any friends her age.\n\nThe next day, after I finished more paint work for her dad, I ran into her, I went to her room and we played some board game and watched some cartoons.\n\nAs we did the day after that.\n\nAll the way until her dad's house was fully painted. And on that last day, she asked me timidly if I would come back and play with her some more. I still remember her sheepish voice and her face - so different from her dorky grin or happily smile that lite her features during our playtime. Out of both sympathy and friendship, I agreed. \n\nAnd so it came to pass that, for the next several years I would always go over to her house at least every weekend. Although I was a pretty much denser than any anime MC, I soon started to notice things. The container on top of her dresser with the labels for monday, tuesday, wednesday, etc., and the multicolored pills inside. Her mother periodically poking her head in the door reminding her to take her medicine. Her dad seemingly always on the phone speaking ultra technical jargon to some doctor. \n\nAlthough it did occur to me many times no one should have to live like this so depend on bitter gross tasting pills, there wasn't much I could do except play with her and be her friend... her only friend.\n\nOn a July 4th holiday right after elementary school, I was sitting with her on a hill top watching the fireworks. She was more mature now than she was before, and I was just bigger than before. And so naturally I picked up none of the inner turmoil or roiling emotion that must have gone through her head when she suddenly asked me \"Hey anon, promise me you'll marry me.\"\n\nI was befuddled, I had just ended 5th grade, marriage was about as far from my thoughts as taxes or IRAs. But I figured she must be feeling anxious because we were going to separate middle school (I was going to the local middle school, and she'll continue being home schooled) and would probably have less time to hang out together. So I casually said yes, sure.\n\nIt's funny, how it's always the small things sticks in memory now that I'm older; I remember the relief and the light sparkling in her eyes as I agreed to her demands as if it happened twenty minutes ago instead of twenty years ago.\n\nSo middle school came and went. True to her fears, I did wind up having less time to hang out with her. We still played and had lots of fun when we were together, though. Because of her condition, she managed to develop some amazing skills drawing, building, and creative skills. I remember working on 10k peice puzzles with her on weekend of places like Paris, Tokyo, or California where she wanted to go physically but had to settle for visiting imaginatively, and she would have them finished by the next weekend I came over. In retrospect, I was probably the only person in the world who was with her in her world. \n\nNonetheless, though, when high school came about, our time together only diminished further. Sure she had developed into an extremely pretty girl by this point, but I nevertheless found myself attracted to another girl from school. \n\nThis other girl, who I will refer to as NTR, was strong, popular, and wild\n\nCont. In Part 2\n\nNotes On RSpec / Best Practices\n=\nGranted I've been using RSpec for over a year now, I'm apparently still learning about how best to use this tool Here are some best practice tips\n\n* Never stack describe / context blocks deeper than 2 layers, use fixtures and mocks instead. This helps make each describe block modular and eases refactoring.\n* Watch for using mock / stubs in multithreaded testing, the code will occasionally lock up or fail inexplicable. \n\nOn the Train Home\n=\nToday, on my way home, I chanced upon a father with his two young boys. The kind man I sat next to gave up his seat for the boys so they can sit down. The father, with that sort of dorky smile that only a father with kids in tow could pull off, chuckled and mused \"You boys might be young now, but one day you'll get bigger and we can all stand as a family.\"\n\nMaybe I'm reading too deeply into this, but there was a certain hint of hopefulness and acceptance of the passage of time in his voice that seemed to connotate a life bathed in the sort blissful happiness that I suppose (to parents) only children can provide.\n\nAs is the case with these chance encounters on the BART, I will most likely never see this balding father with his two young boys or hear them happily gawk at whatever sort of galaxy star-trek game they're currently immersed in, but nonetheless, my best wishes go to them. May they live happily and meaningfully." )
